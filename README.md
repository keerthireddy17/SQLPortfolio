My SQL Portfolio, has different SQL projects

1. Analysis Of Debt Statistics:
Humans not only take debts to manage necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.
In this project, I am going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.

2.Analysis Of Unicorn Companies
Did you know that the average return from investing in stocks is 10% per year (not accounting for inflation)? But who wants to be average?!

You have been asked to support an investment firm by analyzing trends in high-growth companies. They are interested in understanding which industries are producing the highest valuations and the rate at which new high-value companies are emerging. Providing them with this information gives them a competitive insight as to industry trends and how they should structure their portfolio looking forward.
